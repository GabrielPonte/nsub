# nsub
nsub is a matlab function that returns a non singular submatrix

[R,C] = nsub(A,r) returns r rows and columns that are linear independent

[R,C,time] = nsub(A,r) returns r rows and columns that are linear independent with the elapsed time to run the algorithm

A(R,C) is a non singular submatrix of A
